<h2>CATEGORY: CYBERSECURITY</h2>

One of my favorite things in the world was when my twin sister called me for tech support. Unfortunately, like many security professionals, I was replaced by ChatGPT. 

But non-tech professionals shouldn't be left behind in an increasingly technical world. Bad actors often rely on the fact that people don't fully understand the implications of a neglected personal setup. 

People routinely ask me how to secure their personal environment. Maybe they've gotten hacked, or maybe they've recently read a headline. And there are plenty of online resources <a href = "https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Human-Trafficking-and-Cyber-Scam-Operations.pdf">(here's a Github repo)</a> that are spectacular, it's hard to find them in a sea of articles that reduce security into a few products. 

The million dollar question is this: what are high ROI steps someone can take that renders an environment safe but practical? 

<b>1. Strong Passwords</b>

Hackers still guess passwords all the time. Very basic passwords, like password123 or childname234 can be enough for your account to get hacked. 

But is it realistic to expect humans to memorize dozens of long, high-entropy passwords?

Not really.

<b>2. Password Managers</b>

Advice about remembering 18 character passwords is fantastical advice. Same goes with using a unique password for every account. Password managers solve both of these problems since they're in a vault, meaning you only have to remember one password - the one for your password manager! 1Password and Keeper are both reputable options.  Much less painful. 

<b>3. Multi-factor Authentication</b>

The Onion recently wrote an<a href = "https://theonion.com/study-97-of-average-americans-day-spent-retrieving-6-digit-codes/"> article</a> joking, "by the American Journal Of Sociology revealed that the average American dedicates 97% of their day to retrieving six-digit validation codes." 

It's mildly annoying, but Microsoft researchers <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/">found </a>that, "MFA can block over 99.9 percent of account compromise attacks." 

Now how do we reduce friction? This can be simplified by downloading a trusted authenticator app just as Duo or Google Authenticator. Most platforms let you connect your account to codes that'll be displayed in the app. 

No more 'resend code' glitches.

<b>4. Ad Blockers</b> 

This is a great security practice but might make your browsing experience a lot smoother anyway. Fake download buttons, scripts, and redirects to sketchy websites can mostly be eliminated with an Ad Blocker. Products such as uBlock Origin and AdBlock Plus are easy to install (they're often extensions.) 

<b>5. Anti-Virus</b> 

For most people, protection is less about sophisticated attackers and more about preventing digital hazards. Most modern operating systems already have endpoint protection, such as Windows Defender. I personally recommend MalwareBytes because it's more interactive and user-friendly. A large portion of common viruses and suspicious downloads can be rules out by simple solutions. 

<b>6. VPN</b>

We've all gotten hit with NordVPN ads in the middle of Youtube videos which is why everyone seems to know about them. They might be overrated at this point since most of the things you do on your browser are already hidden (encrypted.) But there's still some privacy benefit and safety when you're connecting to hotel or cafe WiFi. ProtonVPN has been great for me, but I've heard that ExpressVPN and Surfshark are user-friendly. 

Anyone with a smartphone or email should be aware of security practices, but no one's really expecting perfection here. A few basic steps rule out the vast majority of threats.
