<h2>CATEGORY: TECH + SOCIETY</h2>

I never liked the term 'skilled labor.' If there's a type of labor without skills, what exactly are they executing? If the answer isn't sleeping, eating, or breathing - congratulations! A skill is being used. 

Some prefer 'credentialed labor' which applies to surgeons and pilots. Not technology though. Software development, cybersecurity, and IT all don't really have a bar to pass. There are degrees and certification paths you can take - but they're not required. 

What technology professionals fail to understand is that their technical skills - coding, hacking, fixing - are just tasks. Like trades. There is no trait you have to innately have in order to run a password cracker. The whole entire AI replacements situation stems from the fact that technologists have always over-identified with their ability to execute tasks. Such as, being a very fast programmer. Or being wicked good at fixing a printer. People were (partially) getting paid to identify what problems had to be solved, and whether they could figure it out. But the perception became 'technology professionals = implementers' and now that rolled us into an era of sophistically implemented, terrible products that were automated end-to-end.

Wait, who decided the last part? 

The organizations we work for. Since that's how you viewed yourself - a doer. Your only contribution is carrying out a task, rather than someone who makes decisions surrounding it.

If you define your professional identity primarily as execution, organizations will eventually treat you as replaceable execution capacity.

Automation completely makes sense. I feel as though there's almost a level of contempt that organizations have - to hand responsibility onto another person. That's another layer of control that they have to sacrifice, and to some, that's another layer that could completely go wrong. 

So automate anything that a machine can do - and do the next best thing in case you ever need employees. Automate their judgment. Organizations externalize decision-making into systems because they distrust autonomy. If you outline everything that someone has to do, if anything goes wrong, it's not your problem, right? That and quite literally, anyone can do it. And maybe one day, they can be automated too. 

But what gets lost when you automate that judgment? 

The ability to solve the problem isn't how technology came this far. It was the ability to identify that there's an influx in certain types of incidents - and creates a fix for that (firewalls!) Or that we could communicate with anyone over a network (the internet!) Even the wheel, mirror, and gunpowder all required a level of creativity and demand for its existence. And what Florence was to the Renaissance, Silicon Valley is to the information age.

That electricity that propped this whole operation up - that's a technologist's skill. Without that electricity, we just have raw materials and some VC cash flow. Stagnation.

I hope we cut it out with the self-training documentation and this visceral need to make people as interchangeable as possible.  This doesn't just undervalue the craft - it drives away everyone who's actually good at it. I completely understand that leaders get nervous about autonomous people, but that's what differentiates a leader from an orchestrator.

Let's treat skilled labor like what it is. Skilled. I'm not going to act like we can automate our way to a breakthrough because we can't.
