<h2>CATEGORY: TECH + SOCIETY</h2>

It doesn't take too long for information security professionals to find that they're defending against attackers that are more sophisticated than a 12 year old with access to the dark web. For those of us who work in enterprise environments, these are primarily organized crime syndicates with financial motives. But that's where the threat modeling ends. Priorities shift back to better tooling, more sophisticated technical controls, and researching what's being done instead of who's doing it. 

Cyber crime doesn't run on malware. We intuitively know that these organizations aren't that different to companies here - they aim to profit using labor. Business email compromise, tailored phishing, and romance scams require human labor at massive scales. Security professionals rarely acknowledge that this labor is often involuntary. We often fail to acknowledge that the other side of the keyboard isn't an evil criminal mastermind, but rather a trafficking victim which is one missed quota away from physical violence.

I think there's an appeal to reducing adversaries down to criminal masterminds. Cybersecurity is a VERY Hollywood-coded field. Being able to defend infrastructure from a Bond villain sounds a lot cooler than someone that is quite literally chained to a desk. 

I've had conversations with people who seriously say, "You need to think like a criminal to really be in cyber." 

The criminals are thinking that they'd like to see their family again.

No seriously, lay off the true crime. 

What really creates these conditions are structural inequality.

These scam operations don’t rely on malice so much as the absence of viable alternatives. COVID-19 and other recent events destablized economies, particularly countries in Southeast Asia, which left many people out of work. <a href = "https://time.com/6344077/pig-butchering-scam-trafficking-victims-trauma/?utm_source=copilot.com"> Fraudulent job listings </a> cropped up and many victims were recruited into trafficking operations. 

According to the <a href = "https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Human-Trafficking-and-Cyber-Scam-Operations.pdf">State Department,</a> these scams included, "quota-based fraudulent sales; illegal online gambling and investment schemes; and romance scams, in which the victim is forced to enter into a fake online relationship with and extract money from unsuspecting targets." 

While the State Department highlights romance scams and fraudulent sales, security analysts should recognize that phishing emails are almost certainly part of this same labor exploitation. The sheer scale of scam compounds means that many of the phishing campaigns defenders block daily are staffed by trafficking victims coerced into social-engineering work.

A core component of how to spot a trafficking-backed attack? Quotas. While reading through a lot of this material, volume seems like the biggest tell on whether you're seeing voluntary behavior. 

Take this example: "In one case, an unemployed 26-year-old woman from the Philippines responded to a Facebook post offering call center jobs to English speakers. Several months pregnant and hoping to earn money before having her baby, she traveled to Cambodia to begin work, only to be flown to a shuttered hotel casino in Sihanoukville
and locked in a cell without food or water for days. Her captors detained and abused her for months, forcing her to create fake profiles on dating apps and other social media platforms to lure people into fraudulent cryptocurrency and other investment schemes under impossible sales quotas. She managed to escape but, tragically, not before the loss of her unborn child"

That highly repetitive content you see isn't thoughtless - it's scripted. And those time zone anomalies? Those are 16 hour shifts. The people behind those unnatural bursts of emails are trying to meet deadlines that are structurally impossible to meet. 

I mostly do defensive work as a security analyst. And most SOC analysts don't remember the details of every alert they've triaged. But I grew up in Thailand - a country often associated with trafficking. What haunts me more than any incident I've worked on were the people I saw there that weren't quite right. Their bodies were gaunt. Their eyes were lifeless. I'm sure they wanted to speak but were accompanied by those who spoke for them. 

Cybercrime isn’t just a technical problem. It’s a labor problem. And until we’re willing to see exploitation for what it is, we’ll keep focusing on the wrong kind.
