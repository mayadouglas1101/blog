<h2>CATEGORY: TECH + SOCIETY</h2>

Note: This piece reflects patterns I’ve observed across the industry, not any one organization.

I always stretched my neck towards the side of the queue. Mostly because I was shorter than the other 8 year olds. I wanted to see the facial reactions of our teacher when she measured our temperatures with those disposable strips that you put on your forehead. 

Most of the time, I was right. We had a very expressive teacher. She was also from the US - Pennsylvania, I believe - so she may have been a little more fazed by the tropical disease situation. So she'd raise her eyebrows when she saw a high temperature. Maybe it was warranted? Dengue fever was no joke. 

But to us, it was another fact of life. Same with the candles in the basement for those blackouts during rainy season. Or the casual military presence during those coups people were so apathetic to. We were so used to it. It got to the point where dengue fever was in the same rotation as 'flu' and 'cold.' 

The two behaviors - the furrowed eyebrows, the apathy - is the reality underbudgeted security departments see. Unaddressed CVEs? Abandoned artifacts of an attempted audit? Putting 'false positive' on inconvenient alerts? You're unbothered unless you're new.

The normalization of risk. We all want to think that we divorce our judgment from our humanity. But we really can't. I'd even say that risk assessments in cybersecurity will always be tainted by bias if you live the environment you're supposed to protect.

But to us, it became part of the environment.

Unpatched CVEs lingered the way legacy systems always do. Critical alerts blended into the background once the SIEM stopped being quiet. Emergency changes became routine because there was never time to do them properly.

Eventually, high-risk findings rotated alongside low-impact ones, until “critical” held about as much urgency as “informational.”

The issue lies in priorities. Information security is an emerging field that's still seen as a function of an IT department as opposed to its own business function. Its still in its survival phase, kind of like a developing country. It's underfunded, underprioritized, and subordinate to 'real IT.' Autonomy is limited at best. Why do we expect the people drowning in tickets to flag issues that they've implemented? Is that not a conflict of interest? Therefore we start normalizing risk. I wouldn't even say we're 'accepting' risks at that point, because that would imply we ever had a choice.

However, we don't have to accept this as reality. Some fields have this figured out. And not like, half-baked. I'm talking surgical precision. Finance has robust compliance officers with legitimate autonomy and budget. Since risk is seen as its own function as opposed to 'something we might have time for when the investment bankers aren't investing.' Issues are flagged and policies are written, and every participant is aware of the consequences that follow if the policies are neglected. 

Risk isn't normalized - it's addressed. 

Until we give security the same structural independence we give finance, we're just asking people to stay alarmed about dengue fever while living in the tropics. 

It doesn't work. 

It never has.
