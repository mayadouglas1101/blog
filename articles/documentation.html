<h2>CATEGORY: TECH + SOCIETY</h2>

I was partially inspired by <a href = "https://www.noidea.dog/glue">‘Being Glue’,</a> a wonderful article by Tanya Reilly that touches on one of the biggest traps early-career women in technical fields fall into (highly recommend!) It actually directly references documentation as one of those very appreciated yet non-promotable tasks that might be doing you more harm than good. 

Anyone who knew me in college knows that I was a very, very proud writer for my college’s <a href = "https://www.hercampus.com/author/maya-douglas/">Her Campus </a>chapter. So documentation came naturally to me and I’ve been a heavy contributor to most of the tech-related jobs I’ve worked. And I’ve always gotten praised for it but it’s never been integrated. And last but not least, no one is contributing. 

So one person usually writes a slop of policies, procedures, and knowledge that will lie dormant in a repository without seeing the light of day. And if content exists in a repository, but no employee is there to use it, does it even make an impact? Absolutely not! 

Knowledge-based documentation is hypothetically the most impactful shortcut that a company can use. Processes get smoother, scaling gets easier, and yes, they will make more money when that happens. Lots more. 

And I think leadership often sees the blocker of documentation writing being time. Because people say they’re too busy. Or maybe they'd forget to maintain it. Or the SME already knows the content, so what's the point of writing it down? But this gets us to the bus factor conversation - what if the SME gets hit by a bus? Wins the lottery? Gets promoted? Leaves?

People know that a person isn’t a plan. They’re not a process. No system or company should be so fragile as to collapse if one person is out. Not even the founder. So why are we digging our heels into the dirt, hoarding information like our lives depend on it? 

But that’s the thing. People’s lives DO depend on hoarding information. Especially after layoffs and employers being uh, creative, with their use of at-will employment, people aren’t optimizing for contribution or scaling. They don’t give a shit about scaling. They care about not being fired. They’re not thinking ‘ooh, it would be so awesome if I can make my CEO be super rich!’ They’re thinking ‘I can’t miss mortgage payments.’ 

Leadership observes the bus factor as a risk but can't address it - not realizing that engineers are using that exact factor to assure that their lives aren’t upended if the next round of funding doesn’t go as planned. 

Cybersecurity professionals should especially be innovating and ensuring that their org is safe, even if they were hit by a bus. So they should understand the weight of documentation. So the real security vulnerability isn't going to be solved by tools, but psychological safety. If you've read up on Project Aristotle by Google (ironically,) you'd see where I'm going with this. 

I'm not saying that employees really do this intentionally, nor do I think that is a 'management is evil' situation. I just think that without understanding the field, higher-ups might find things that are vital to security and the company as a whole, as redundant. And artificially bottlenecking processes to avoid redundancy is the ultimate drag to any company that wants to get anything done. Never mind innovate. But furthermore - if people who run the company don't know what incentivizes their employees, they'll A. Use even more fear (ineffective, caused this issue in the first place), B. Lean on praise (not relevant to job security), or C. Try to embed it as a performance metric. 

C is a good option on the surface. Technical people like quantifying things. So maybe, an expectation of some number of documents per quarter. But that doesn't change the original goal of keeping the job. If anything, it'll encourage people to create irrelevant, hollow write-ups that STILL don't contain any knowledge or process that can be used by others. 

So I'll circle back to Project Aristotle. The study focused on five effectiveness pillars, which included psychological safety, dependability, structure and clarity, meaning , and impact. The original study's definition of psychological safety was the answer to, "If I make a mistake on our team, it is not held against me." 

I'd argue that in our case with documentation, people are asking "will inaction keep me safer than the wrong action?" If a person only optimizes their actions at work to be self-preservation, including 'two people knowing something' being held against them, they will never make decisions that are great for the company. And therefore, if this is how your team operates, you will never have documentation. You will never have an efficient training process. You will never scale. And if you're a small business, you're giving every reason for your customers to choose a provider that doesn't operate that way. 

What does this have to do with protect people, not pockets? Well I'd argue that we could protect both. 

We're all aware that cybersecurity REALLY want to silicon-valley-fy itself. The VC funding, 17 year olds hopped up on caffiene, and the monoculture that lies in software engineering seems like what we're striving for. 

But why deny our roots? The heart of cybersecurity culture is the intersection two things - DoD culture and hacker culture. The first one is the reason why all of our jargon is military-heavy (attack vector, blast radius, defensive/offensive operations.) It's well-funded and the job is secure as its systems. On the other hand we have hacker culture - quite literally the counterculture to the software dev FAANG glory. Some may like money but it's not coming in through venture capitalists. 

And that’s the tension at the heart of documentation culture.

We keep asking individuals to behave altruistically inside systems that punish altruism. We tell people to “share knowledge” while quietly rewarding fragility, heroics, and opacity. Then we act surprised when documentation doesn’t happen.

Documentation isn’t missing because engineers are lazy, selfish, or bad communicators. It’s missing because knowledge has become leverage in an unstable labor market. And people don’t give up leverage unless they feel safe.

If leaders actually want documentation, they have to do the harder thing: make it safe to be replaceable. Not disposable—replaceable. Replaceable because the system is strong, not because the person is expendable.

Protecting people means building organizations where doing the right thing doesn’t quietly put your livelihood at risk. And the irony is, that’s also how you protect the business.

Documentation doesn’t protect pockets by default. It protects people first. The pockets follow.
