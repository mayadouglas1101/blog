Hi Johnny - here's some of the writing. I'm having a hard time testing it all since there's a blocker (there's a scrolling problem) but most of the dialogue is done. 

hi! my name's maya. this is a blog about the human factor of cybersecurity.
 hi maya 
 I WOULD LIKE TO SKIP THIS DIALOGUE 

now that we're acquainted, tell me a little bit about yourself.
 
-> i'm a tech and ethics enthusiast!
 -> what are you interested in? 
 -> artificial intelligence
  -> Very cool! What's your take on it?
   -> terrible! have you seen the terminator? 
    -> i fell asleep halfway through that movie. for ai though - i guess we'll see?
   -> it's all just statistics. 
    -> but isn't human behavior largely just reacting to data input? that'll be explored on my blog!
   -> i outsource my thinking to ChatGPT. 
    -> i'm a top 0.1% ChatGPT user. can we be friends?
   -> it's a powerful tool with potential for abuse.
    -> i completely agree with this take! with great power comes great responsibility - and it's in the hands of us. 
 -> cybersecurity 
  -> how come? 
   -> i want money 
    -> doesn't hurt, right?
   -> i want to be a hacker
    -> i hope the good kind! breaking things is fun, and it doesn't always require breaking the law. 
   -> i want to protect people!
    -> you know that roman guy that's associated with that orange-flavored dairy queen beverage? thfhkvbnhz1101@nthps.jvt. you should also check out osint! (redirects to osint)
 -> Humanitarian/mission-based efforts
  -> what kind? 
   -> protecting our country's assets
    -> it's not as warm and fuzzy as a soup kitchen, but it makes an impact. mad respect! you should also start checking out osint - people like us crowdsource intelligence gathering. pretty neat, right?
   -> protecting vulnerable populations 
    -> you'll love this blog <3
   -> combating misinformation
    -> you know what's more important than some stakeholder's wallet? democracy! 
   -> accessible software (disabled) 
    -> this is definitely not as touched on as it should be. you're awesome!
   -> civil rights tech!
    -> tech in its purest form is profit-neutral, feminist, and has the potential to progress humanity. and to understand that, is the beginning of a movement.
